# Easy Villager Trades

Easy Villager Trades is a datapack by PearUhDox that allows for creating easy trades and adding them to Villagers in game.

In order to do this, first you will want to place a hopper and fill it with items based on parameters of the trade.

The first slot in the hopper will be the villager's first Buy item (the first item on the left side of the trade).

The second slot in the hopper will be the villager's second Buy item (the second item on the left side of the trade).

The third slot in the hopper will be the villager's Selling item (the only item on the right side of the trade).

The fourth slot is the number of uses the villager's trade has, up to 64.

The fifth slot is the number of uses the trade has, but in 64 increments. (So a combination of 1 item in the fourth slot and 1 item in the fifth slot is 65 total trade uses.)

Pick up the hopper with the nbt inside (CTRL + Pick Block key) and right click it on an existing villager to add the trade to the villager.
For best results, the villager should be a custom one made with a command.

You can remove the last added trade on a villager by right clicking on them with a Poisonous Potato.

(Remove this datapack from your map before releasing it, so players cannot use these features.)
